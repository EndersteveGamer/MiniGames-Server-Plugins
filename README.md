# MiniGames Server Plugins
 All the plugins that I use on my personal CloudNet Minecraft server

The Main plugin is used in the lobby of the server  
The Global plugin is used in the proxy (to run on a single instance) and handles communication between the different servers and database interactions  
The Spleef plugin is used in the Spleef minigame  
The Arrow Wars plugin is used in the Arrow Wars minigame
